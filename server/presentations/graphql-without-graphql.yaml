    title: Why I Began to Use GraphQL
    markup: |
      1. Initially my content was tied to my website
      2. Mobile app needed to consume the same data
      3. A content API was needed and GraphQL fit the bill

    title: How SFD works in context of GraphQL
    markup: |
      1. Think of the main concepts of your system (i.e., `Conference`, `Contact`, `Location`, `Theme`)
      2. Think of the fields and types the concepts have (i.e., `name`, `description`)
      3. Think of the nature of the fields (i.e. where does the data come from)
